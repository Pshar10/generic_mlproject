```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pshar10/generic_mlproject.git
   cd generic_mlproject
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your raw data in the `data/` directory or use the data loading scripts in `src/data/` to fetch and process datasets.
   - Configuration for data processing can be modified in the `config/` directory.

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train a model with default configurations, run:
```bash
python main.py --train
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model on test data:
```bash
python main.py --evaluate
```

### Configurations
Adjust parameters, paths, and settings by modifying files in the `config/` directory.

## Notebooks
For exploratory data analysis and initial experimentation, refer to Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This project can be deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for a scalable, managed hosting environment.

1. **Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI**:
   Follow the [AWS EB CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html).

2. **Initialize the Elastic Beanstalk Application**:
   Run the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   eb init -p python-3.7 generic_mlproject
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

3. **Create and Deploy the Environment**:
   ```bash
   eb create generic-ml-env
   eb deploy
   ```

4. **Open the Application**:
   After deployment, you can view your application using:
   ```bash
   eb open
   ```
